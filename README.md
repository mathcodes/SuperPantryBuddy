## Overview
Tell SPB your dietary restrictions and what is inside your pantry and you will be given a list of concise, no-fluff recipes.  Gone are the days of reading through a chef’s life story, only to find later on that the dish uses a cream sauce when you clearly googled vegan pasta. Say goodbye to google and let SPB plan tonight’s meal.

## Concept

### Description
	A web app that returns a detailed list of recipes based on a user’s 
	ingredient list, dietary restrictions and cuisine preference

### Motivation for Development
	Dissatisfaction with google’s recipe search results 

### User Story
	A user on a ketogenic diet, craving a thai dish may have to read 
	through dozens of recipes in google results.  With SPB, that search
	is done in seconds after entering their ingredients on hand
