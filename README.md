## Overview
Tell SPB your dietary restrictions and what is inside your pantry and you will be given a list of concise, no-fluff recipes.  Gone are the days of reading through a chef’s life story, only to find later on that the dish uses a cream sauce when you clearly googled vegan pasta. Say goodbye to google and let SPB plan tonight’s meal.

## Concept
Say you are on a keto diet, craving a Thai dish, on a budget, and only have a few items in his pantry, including limes and noodles. Super Pantry Buddy can help you out and find Thai recipes which cater to the keto diet, and include limes and noodles. Done.

In short, Super Pantry Buddy, (SPB), is a web app that returns a detailed list of recipes based on a user’s ingredient list, dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences. The main purpose and motivation behind developing this application was to help users avoid wasting or throwing away food while improving their diet. There is more users can get from Super Pantry Buddy, such as saving customized meals based on personal preferences, diets, limitations, pantry inventory, budget, time, and more.
